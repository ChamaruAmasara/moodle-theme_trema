============================
![image1](pix/screenshot.gif "Trema Screenshot")

The theme trema focus in usability and beaty, so for that became real 
the developers try to make something clean and usable for everyone in community.

The main idea from this theme is use Moodle not necessarily 
with other site for divulgation.

Nice features in trema:
 - It's based in theme boost, so will continue compatible with Moodle 
 for a long time.
 - The frontpage is fully customized. It's possible to change the image 
 banner, you can create up to six beautiful cards with custom contents and
 you can add custom HTML content with no restrictions.
 - The login page is awesome with [Particles lib](https://github.com/mmacheerpuppy/particles.js).
 - We really use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to make theme fully responsive.
 - The footer is pretty customizable and we have a exclusive admin area 
 block that just one administrator of Moodle can see and access.
 - Thinking a litte more about the administrators we made the admin 
 dashboard area. So they can see in real time some infos about their Moodle.
